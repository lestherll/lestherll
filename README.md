### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=lestherll)

I'm Lesther.
I'm currently a stage 1 Computer Science student at Newcastle University, UK.
I'm looking for projects to work on. I don't have a lot of experience yet although I can tell you that I am very hardworking, reliable, and willing to learn.

Python is my strongest language. I am also proficient at Java.
Java is part of my course together with Go and C.

I have been learning Elm and Kotlin, just to explore other paradigms.
